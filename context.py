Regional variation in mutation rates
chiaromonte.png
Mutation rates vary at a fine scale - even within individual chromosomes. We are using statistical modeling to study such regional variation in mutation rates. Moreover, we are able to segment the genome into regions with high and low rates of different mutation types.
Mutation rates vary at a fine scale - even within individual chromosomes. We are using statistical modeling to study such regional variation in mutation rates. Our analysis of insertions vs. deletions revealed that they are formed, at least in part, by different molecular mechanisms and that, in addition to replication, recombination plays an important role in indel formation (Kvikstad et al. 2007). Employing wavelet transformation techniques, we demonstrated the importance of genomic scale for regional variation in mutation rates (Kvikstad et al. 2009). Using specialized statistical approaches, we have investigated the structure of rate co-variation for four mutation types (point mutations, insertions, deletions, and microsatellite mutations) and simultaneously exploring the associations with multiple genomic features (Ananda et al. 2011). Moreover, we were able to segment the genome into regions with high and low rates of different mutations (Kurupummulage Don, Ananda, et al. 2013). Collaborator: Francesca Chiaromonte.

Mitochondrial mutation dynamics
afgan.png
With sequencing now possible at high depth, we aim to examine mutation process directly, by examining the DNA of children and their parents. Mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) provides a good starting point for such an investigation due to its compact size and high mutation rate.
With sequencing now possible at high depth, we aim to examine mutation process directly, by examining the DNA of children and their parents. Mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) provides a good starting point for such an investigation due to its compact size and high mutation rate. We have established an experimental and computational pipeline to study mtDNA mutations and heteroplasmy frequency shifts (Goto et al. 2011), therefore we are in great position to study the patterns and rates of mtDNA mutations at unprecedented detail. Our recent study suggested that mitochondrial DNA undergoes through a very small bottleneck during oogenesis and that the number of heteroplasmies in the offspring increases with maternal age at fertilization (Rebolledo Jaramillo, Su, et al. 2014). Collaborators: Anton Nekrutenko, Francesca Chiaromonte, Rasmus Nielsen (Figure : Afgan et al. 2011).

Childhood obesity

Obesity is becoming the major epidemic of the 21st century, and we are studying this disease in an integrated way - from the perspective of genomics, microbiomics, and epigenomics. We are following a large group of newborn children until they are at least 3 years of age.
Obesity is becoming the major epidemic of the 21st century, and we are studying this disease in an integrated way - from the perspective of genomics, microbiomics, and epigenomics. We are following a large group of newborn children until they are at least 3 years of age, and will be finding genes linked to the development of obesity in some of them. This collaboration includes clinicians, statisticians, and social scientists to obtain a multifaceted picture of this important phenotype. Collaborators: Ian Paul, Francesca Chiaromonte.

Microsatellite variation and evolution
kelkar.png
We have investigated microsatellite evolution in the framework of a life-cycle hypothesis, according to which microsatellites are born and expand into adulthood, until their degradation and death. Microsatellites are implicated in numerous diseases and used as markers in population genetics and forensics.
We have investigated microsatellite evolution in the framework of a life-cycle hypothesis, according to which microsatellites are born and expand into adulthood, until their degradation and death (Kelkar et al. 2011). Studies of microsatellite mutagenesis have significant utility, as microsatellites are implicated in numerous diseases and are popular markers in population genetics and forensics. To commence this project, we had to determine the minimal number of repeats constituting a microsatellite (Kelkar et al. 2010). Next, using sequenced primate genomes, we dissected the intricacies of the mutational processes leading to microsatellite birth and death (Kelkar et al. 2011). We also evaluated the contribution of transposable elements to microsatellite births and deaths, and described the mechanisms of births for many disease-causing microsatellites (Kelkar et al. 2011). We investigated how interruptions affect microsatellite mutability (Ananda et al. 2014) and developed a computational pipeline, STR-FM, to genotype microsatellites from next-generation sequencing data (Fungtammasan, Ananda, et al. 2015). (Figure: Kelkar et al. 2011). Collaborators: Kristin Eckert, Paul Medvedev, Francesca Chiaromonte.

Sex chromosome evolution
wilson_sayres.png
We are determining the gene repertoire and structure of the Y chromosome in several mammalian species. The Y chromosome has very high rates of mutation compared with other chromosomes in the mammalian genome due to a higher number of cell divisions in the male than female germ line.
Several lines of our recent research have had mammalian sex chromosome evolution as a common theme. We have been studying the genomic determinants of X chromosome inactivation (XCI; Carrel et al. 2006). By contrasting the evolution of genes on sex chromosomes in eutherians with that of their autosomal homologs in marsupials and monotremes, we were able to shed light on the earliest stages of eutherian sex chromosome evolution (Wilson and Makova 2009). We also recently generated a comprehensive list of pseudogenes on the human Y and studied what determines whether a gene will survive or die on this chromosome (Wilson Sayres and Makova 2013). To test whether selection or drift leads to loss of genes on chromosome Y, we sequenced and analyzed all X-degenerate Y chromosome genes in gorilla (Goto et al. 2009) and are currently characterizing such genes in other primates. (Figure : Wilson Sayres & Makova 2013). Collaborators: Laura Carrel, Paul Medvedev.
